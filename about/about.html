I'm Dalitso Banda, a junior front-end web developer with a passion that borders on obsession. By day, I'm a code warrior, battling bugs and solving problems with my trusty laptop by my side. By night, I'm a math wizard, conjuring up algorithms and data structures to tackle the next big challenge.
        </p>
             <p>
Living in Lusaka, Zambia, I've learned to embrace my geekiness and make it a part of my everyday life. When I'm not coding away on my latest project, you can find me pondering the mysteries of calculus or graph theory. There's something about the beauty of math that speaks to me on a deep level - the way numbers and symbols can be combined to create something truly elegant.
              </p>
              <p>
But coding is my true love. There's something about bringing a concept to life with lines of code that gets me every time. It's like solving a puzzle, and I'm hooked. I live for the thrill of the chase, the rush of adrenaline when I finally crack the code. And when I'm not building websites or applications, I'm probably exploring the latest developments in machine learning or artificial intelligence.
            </p>
             <p>
Lately, I've been dabbling in neural networks, trying to wrap my head around the math behind them. It's like trying to solve a Rubik's cube blindfolded, but I'm determined to master it. I spend hours poring over textbooks and online tutorials, practicing my skills and testing my theories. 

              </p>
             <p>
People say I'm a bit of a nerd, and they're right. But I wouldn't have it any other way. I'm living my best life, surrounded by code and math problems, and I wouldn't trade it for anything in the world."
         </p>
